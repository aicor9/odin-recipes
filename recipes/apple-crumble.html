        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother Hazel's recipe which my mom made on a regular basis. She would make two at a time to take to sick or shut-in friends, or to potlucks. There is never any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7 large Cortland apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, cubed</1i>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread apples in an even layer in a deep dish pie plate or 8-inch square glass casserole dish. Cover with white sugar, then top with cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and brown sugar for topping in a bowl. Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender. Spread topping evenly over apple mixture and pat down.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apple mixture is bubbling and topping is browned, about 55 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
